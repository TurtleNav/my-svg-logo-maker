// This module implements our Shape classes and dictates how they are rendered

/*
    Base shape class. Constructor accepts a color (color of the shape), The
    text to be rendered inside the shape, and the color of the interior text. A
    render method that raises an error is added due to the fact that each Shape
    subclass NEEDS to implement a render method.

    Each of the three property setter methods:
        'setColor' / 'setText' / 'setTextColor'
    handle setting their corresponding property for all of the Shape child
    classes.
    
    Default values are provided for faster testing but these values are
    entirely overriden when selecting a shape and its properties from the CLI

        the symbol and I wouldn't want to prevent that.

        The Triangle render method requires us create a polygon. The special
        x/y values for each point in the polygon were calculated with the
        considerations:
            1.) The triangle is equilateral (each side length is equal and each
                internal angle is 60Â°)
            2.) The triangle is not rotated and is symmetric with respect to a
                vertical line of the form x=<value>(bisects the triangle)
            3.) The x value of the vertical line that bisects the triangle
                equally should be the x value of the center of our bounding box
        
        The y value for the text is adjusted to 67% because this places the text
        near the centroid of the shape which for a triangle is 1/3 of the way up
        from the base.
